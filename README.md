**Repository's porpouse:**
This repository is mainly just a way for me to get used to using git, i also use it to learn how to write proper english, hopefully what i just wrote is good enough.

**Repository's contentes**
This repo contains all the exercises give to me from the Operating System course.
Of course every given exercise will have a solution made by me and maybe it will also have
a .txt file that explains how i made.
